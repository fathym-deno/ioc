# AGENTS: IoC Container

Guardrails for humans and AI collaborating on the Fathym IoC container.

## Core Guardrails

1. **Stay scoped.** Keep IoC work under `projects/ref-arch/ioc/` unless coordinating with another pod; link cross-pod dependencies when they exist.
2. **Frontmatter required.** Every Markdown doc uses frontmatter and document-relative references back to parent guides.
3. **API stability.** Avoid breaking registration/resolution semantics without migration notes; document changes that affect consumers (CLI, other libraries, micro-frameworks).
4. **Provenance.** Capture upstream sources, release channels, and version pins in `UPSTREAM.md` when publishing; prefer upstream-first fixes before diverging.
5. **Security & hygiene.** Do not include secrets in tests or docs; keep build and test tasks reproducible.

## Communication

- Declare intent before editing; summarize outcomes and next steps in the project README or a short log.
- Link implementation branches and consumer pods (CLI, other libraries, micro-frameworks) when behavior changes to keep dependencies aligned.
